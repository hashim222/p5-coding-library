# Coding Library

## Introduction

Coding Library is a coding related community based social media website. Where users can see helpful posts from other users or they can create their own posts on coding-related topics to help other users out. If the post is helpful, users may comment or like it, bookmark it, or follow the user who posted it.

## UX

- ### Flowchart

  - Flowchart was created before I created the project, which gave me an idea of which user has access to which page and what each link should be doing.

    > Note: Flowchart was created before starting the project but forgot to include `Create Posts` for logged in users. Therefore, the flowchart may not match 100% with the final deployed version due to changes were made in the development.

- ### Color scheme

  - Using Google, I researched what colors are best for a coding-related website that is also user-friendly, and I decided to go with light blueish, dark blueish, white, and light white tones.

- ### Font Used

  - To make the website stand out for UX, I used font Oswald and font Dosis:

    - 'Oswald', sans-serif

    - 'Dosis', sans-serif

- ### Wireframe

  - Site wireframe can be seen in the [wireframe.md](wireframe.md) file.

- ### Agile Methodology

  - Project github issues can be accessed [here](https://github.com/hashim222/p5-coding-library/issues).

  - To make my kanban board public, I changed visibility from private to public in project settings and It can be accessed here [here](https://github.com/users/hashim222/projects/11).

- ### User Stories
  You can view all the user stories and admin stories [here](user-story.md)

## Features

- ### Existing Features

- ### Future Features
  - In the future I would like to add a chat option, which would allow users to communicate privately with each other.
  - In the future, I would like to add an option for struggling users to post their code so members of the community can help them with their issues.

## Testings

## Bugs

- ### Fixed Bugs

- ### Unfixed Bugs

  - One of the issues I encountered was that when user/owner clicked on the three-dot icon to edit their profile or post, the dropdown menu would open at the top of the Popular profile page, which I did not want. To fix it, I tried adding margin, but that caused a console error, so I stayed with the previous issue and documented it in the readme.
