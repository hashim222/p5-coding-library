# Coding Library

## Introduction

Coding Library is a coding related community based social media website. Where users can see helpful posts from other users or they can create their own posts on coding-related topics to help other users out. If the post is helpful, users may comment or like it, bookmark it, or follow the user who posted it.

## UX

- ### Agile Methodology
- ### Flowchart

  - Flowchart was created before I created the project, which gave me an idea of which user has access to which page and what each link should be doing.

    > Note: Flowchart was created before starting the project but forgot to include `Create Posts` for logged in users. Therefore, the flowchart may not match 100% with the final deployed version due to changes were made in the development.

- ### Color scheme

  - Using Google, I researched what colors are best for a coding-related website that is also user-friendly, and I decided to go with light blueish, dark blueish, white, and light white tones.

- ### Font Used

  - To make the website stand out for UX, I used font Oswald and font Dosis:

    - 'Oswald', sans-serif

    - 'Dosis', sans-serif;
