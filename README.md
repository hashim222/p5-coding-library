# Coding Library

## Introduction

Coding Library is a coding related community based social media website. Where users can see helpful posts from other users or they can create their own posts on coding-related topics to help other users out. If the post is helpful, users may comment or like it, bookmark it, or follow the user who posted it.

## UX

- ### Agile Methodology
- ### Flowchart

  - Flowchart was created before I created the project, which gave me an idea of which user has access to which page and what each link should be doing.

    > Note: project flowchart was created before the project was created and may not match 100% with the final deployed.
